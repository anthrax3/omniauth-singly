# OmniAuth Singly

This is the official OmniAuth strategy for authenticating to Singly. To
use it, you'll need to sign up for an OAuth2 Application ID and Secret
on the [Singly Applications Page](https://singly.com/apps).

## Basic Usage

### Rails

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :singly, ENV['SINGLY_ID'], ENV['SINGLY_SECRET']
    end

### Sinatra

    use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :singly, ENV['SINGLY_ID'], ENV['SINGLY_SECRET']
    end

## Services

You can authorize many services through Singly. Link to

    /auth/singly?service=<service>

To see what services are supported, check the [Service
Overview](https://singly.com/docs/services_overview).

## Scope

Custome scopes can be passed through Singly to a service via the `scope`
parameter:

    /auth/singly?service=<service>&scope=<scope>

For more details, see the [authorization
documentation](https://singly.com/docs/authorization). To see what scopes are
available, check the documentation for the service you're using.
